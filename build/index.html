      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We exist to give all people Jesus by embodying God’s redemptive story.</p>

        <p>Our name and who we are come from Luke 24. Jesus meets two disciples traveling the Emmaus road on the very day Jesus walked out of the grave. As the two disciples were walking the seven mile road from Jerusalem to Emmaus, they were freely sharing their sadness, discouragements, and the pain of Jesus’ death. We call this display of authenticity and vulnerability along the road as “Journey Together.” We long to journey together in house churches, living a life of vulnerability, authenticity, and being known.</p>

        <p>As Jesus meets these two weary and discouraged disciples, he begins engaging them, and opens the Scriptures to them. As they reached Emmaus, and invited Jesus to break bread with them, they realized this man was the Resurrected Jesus. They both looked to each other and remarked that their hearts were burning inside of them as they spent time with Jesus. We long for our hearts to be warmed as we regularly “Behold Jesus” in our Sunday Gatherings and House Churches.</p>

        <p>After these disciples realized Jesus truly rose from the dead in alignment with God’s redemptive story, they left immediately and traveled this seven mile road back to Jerusalem. Eagerly, they spread the hope of the living resurrected King that they experienced on their journey to Emmaus. We see this as an example of what it means to “Spread Hope” in our everyday life. We eagerly spread the hope of a living resurrected King who conquered sin, shame, and death to everyone who will listen and receive this good news.</p>

        <p>We believe that if we are to give all people Jesus by embodying God’s redemptive story we need to continually walk this road as we Journey Together, Behold Jesus, Spread Hope.</p>
